Here's an updated **README.md** file, including the use of `useState` for managing state in your React Tic Tac Toe project:

# Tic Tac Toe React

This is a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React**. It demonstrates core React concepts such as **state management** with `useState`, **props**, and component-based architecture.

## Features

- A fully functional **Tic Tac Toe** game.
- Uses React's **`useState`** to manage:
  - The state of each square on the board.
  - Tracking the current player (X or O).
  - Determining the winner or a tie.
- Displays dynamic messages such as the current player's turn or the winner.
- Allows players to reset the game.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tictactoe-react.git
   cd tictactoe-react
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the game in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Components

### **1. Square.jsx**
- Represents an individual square on the game board.
- Utilizes `props` to receive the current value (`X`, `O`, or empty) and a click handler function.
- Example snippet:
  ```jsx
  function Square({ value, onClick }) {
    return (
      <button className="square" onClick={onClick}>
        {value}
      </button>
    );
  }
  ```

### **2. Board.jsx**
- Manages the state of the game using `useState`.
- Tracks the game board's squares, the current player, and checks for a winner.
- Example snippet:
  ```jsx
  const [squares, setSquares] = useState(Array(9).fill(null));
  const [isXNext, setIsXNext] = useState(true);

  const handleClick = (index) => {
    if (squares[index] || calculateWinner(squares)) return;

    const nextSquares = squares.slice();
    nextSquares[index] = isXNext ? 'X' : 'O';
    setSquares(nextSquares);
    setIsXNext(!isXNext);
  };
  ```

### **3. App.js**
- Integrates the **Board** component into the application.
- Acts as the entry point for the game.

## React Features Used

- **`useState`**: 
  - Used to manage:
    - The state of the squares on the board.
    - The current player's turn.
  - Dynamically updates the board and the status message based on user interactions.

## Gameplay

1. Players take turns clicking squares to mark their move (X or O).
2. The app checks for a winner after every move.
3. Displays a message when a player wins or when the game ends in a tie.
4. The "Reset Game" button clears the board and starts a new game.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm test`: Runs tests (if implemented).

## Technologies Used

- React: For building the UI and managing state with `useState`.
- CSS: For styling the game board and components.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a "Player vs Computer" mode using AI.
- Include animations for winning lines.
- Improve the UI/UX with enhanced styles and effects.
